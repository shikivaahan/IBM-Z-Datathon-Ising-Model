Hockeygoalie41,AutoModerator,"I am sad my team's (Rowdies) last few games have been moved due to hurricane damage to the stadium, one being played away today and the last two relocated further south. 

It does reinforce my opinion that EPL and La Liga and whomever else should not play real games over here in US, they should be at home for the fans. Obviously the situations are different, making those presumptive matches much worse as it's a choice and not a necessity.

I applaud the club for making the credits and refunds easy for those of us with season seats that can't make the relocated matches.",-1

RustyLugs,AutoModerator,"Six pointer at home for our Richmond Kicker's against Chattanooga, we're squeaking by in the final place of qualifying for the playoffs at 21 points.

TheGTAone,AutoModerator,"Barcelona SC is playing the [""Shipyard derby""](https://studiofutbol.com.ec/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hinchada-de-barcelona-y-emelec.jpg) against Emelec on Sunday. It's named like that because both clubs were founded along the same street ""Barrio del Astillero"" in Guayaquil, Ecuador. It goes along the Guayas River, which held at a time (1920s) many of the most important ports of Ecuador.

Probably the biggest match in Ecuador, sadly both teams are in their worst form ever in a decade. Barcelona is currently in a footballing crisis after ditching their second coach of the season, Ariel Holan, as he lost the dressing room. Crashed out of Copa Libertadores, Copa Sudamericana, Copa Ecuador in unfashionable ways, their only hope is to get some form and fight for the top league spot to save the season.

Emelec on the other hand, is currently on a cash flow problem. FIFA handed them a transfer ban until 2025 for not paying wages and prize money to some former players. They can't even meet their current squad's payroll on time, so sometimes they won't even have training. 

To put the cherry on top, Ecuador is currently facing **8-hour power outages around the country,** so people aren't in the best mood either. Match will be played in broad daylight after many years.

Both teams are playing some horrid football, but Barcelona SC will probably have the new manager bounce, so I'm attending for the derby experience. Many people will do, to at least, forget the current political and economic struggles of their daily lives.",-1
Hop3sAndF3ars,AutoModerator,Frustrating not to hold on for the win but after Tuesday night good to go away to a decent side and give them a game. Incredible the difference having an actual manager in charge makes.,1
_mnd,AutoModerator,"Eastleigh at home for us today, they've tended to be a bit of a bogey team for us and we've got 3 wins against them in 20something games. It's technically a derby because we're both from Hampshire but it's not really because nobody actually really cares about Eastleigh.

Last season saw 3 bizarre meetings between us. In the first our keeper got sent off early and we didn't have one on the bench so we played most of the game with an outfielder in goal and lost 3-0. Then we met in the FA Trophy where they had a player sent off and we came from 2-0 down to win on penalties. A week later they were 5-0 up within an hour at our place in the league before the game ended 5-3.

Eastleigh come into the game in fairly mixed form whereas we're in dreadful form. We won in the FA Cup last weekend and the pointless cup in midweek but we're on a run of no wins in seven in the league and we haven't scored in three consecutive home league games. We're incredibly short of defenders because they're all injured/suspended and I suspect we're going to struggle in this game. Score prediction: 2-0 Eastleigh.",-1
ItsRainbowz,AutoModerator,"We won a game!! Granted our finishing was absolutely dire and we stumbled to the end against 10 men, but we did it! We've got Blackett back too now, so we should start scoring again soon, but it's worrying how dependant we are on him. None of our strikers look close to scoring (our goal today was a defender from a corner) but Blackett is consistently reliable. If he gets injured again, I'll be scared",1
hornyforbrutalism,AutoModerator,"Oviedo 0-0 Málaga, 103rd minute, we concede a penalty because Luengo is holding back one of their attackers (many in our fanbase are conspiracy-brained but I think this is his fault, it was the right call to me)

PrisonersofFate,2soccer2bot,"Latest update about my son and his U10 team 

I couldn't go today as I had to work so that's my wife who went to watch. I always tell her how good he is and how he is improving 

They lost 13-0 and that was a disaster 😂 

It seems he was guilty on a few goals but you can't put the blame on the keeper. They faced a team that was the local selection of the whole province next to us, and they were U11 when his team is only made of U10. But it seems they were insulting each others, laughing while losing so they might have to work on the team spirit. A few think they are great when they can just push the ball and try to run. I wish they could face my team, the B team, they could end up surprised.

They still plan doing a tournament in Montpellier in may. My son would be picked and I could join. I'm excited. Two of my players should make the squad as well",-1

cuteguy1,2soccer2bot,"Couldn't find the post match thread so i'll chuck it in here. This Fulham/Villa game reminded me why being a football fan especially of a mid table team can be an absolutely miserable experience. Didn't even play that badly, but just about everything that could go wrong did, missed pen, own goal that killed off the game, red card that wasnot really the fault of the defender just as you were chasing a lead. 

I will also say I understand why Andreas and Robinson are two of our biggest assets but they showed why today I can never completely trust them and if either of them do move to better teams they have some stuff to sort out. Robinson's crossing was absolutely horrific today and its always been his achilles heel that he has improved on but his touch was a bit off as well and Andreas for all his positives can just make such bad decisions.

We just lost our two most creative and best players, so what do we do? We play Sterling RW who even in his prime was known for getting on the end of chances and Merino RCM whose best trait is getting about winning the ball and securing the middle. Arteta fielded a team whose most creative players were Calafiori and White who are both CB’s turned FB’s. Is this not concerning to anyone? Why is it still a crazy idea to play Nwanieri? We legitimately don’t have any midfield or front line solutions to the creativity issue? Why is it not concerning that Arteta refuses to make a selection that involves risk/bravery? 


Pep sent Cancelo away and played this kid called Rico Lewis and it led them to figuring out the shape that won them the treble. Klopp was up against the wall and found that Connor Bradley is a decent option when losing their star in Trent. Why is it such a wild idea that Nwaneri could be the one that provides some of what we lost with Odegaard and now Saka?

Liverpool will be seen as favourites for the title around the turn of the year if i had to guess right now; this is an opinion based on many years of watching the sport widely known as football, and taking a special interest in the English Premier League besides. What will happen past that though, is anyone's guess - the second half of any given season often feels like a different campaign altogether. All things considered, if you're a Liverpool fan you have a lot to be optimistic about, and hopes of #20 look better than they did in months gone.

Compared to what's potentially a down year, yes: 02/03 and 05/06 had 75 sendings-off, last season had 58 in total.  

That's nearly double than the previous season, but 19/20 (45) and 20/21 (48) had significantly more than the 30 of 22/23 as well. I don't think there's much of a trend in the numbers here, really: Rules and enforcement change, teams adapt, and it's ultimately fine.

Would you rather refs *not* clamp down on shocking tackles and time wasting if it meant fewer sendings-off - or would you rather players take responsibility for their actions and stop trying to break the rules and get away with it scott-free?",1

>Had Cancelo worked hard and tried securing his place, Pep may have had to choose between Stones and Ake as well.

Where would his place be? He wasn't safe enough on the ball to invert next to Rodri like Stones/Lewis and he wasn't good enough defensively to play as part of the in possession back 3.

The first 10 games where he played, City was firing on all cylinders.  United Away fixture was what broke the camel's back.  Cancelo basically played for United in that game despite being one of the better players on the pitch. 

Pep wasn't seriously considering ghosting Cancelo back in Oct 22 for sure.  The rift started early, tho. My suspicion is around the time Cancelo got his red card.

Like look at someone like Jude Bellingham: He's clearly an absolutely brilliant player, but he's also constantly moaning into the ref's ear and prone to have a strop when things don't quite go his way. It's not any better or worse than Busquets, it's just that he's not quite got the reputation for it yet, be that through nationality, youth, or whatever else. 

End of the day I reckon 80% of professional footballers are incredibly annoying to play against, and singling out someone like Busquets is ultimately just pointing the finger at someone when there's easily a few dozen people doing the exact same thing in the exact same annoying way right now. 

If they're playing for your club, you'll defend and celebrate them, if you're up against them you'll hat their guts. That's just football, really, and Sneijder wasn't exactly the most beloved opponent around either here, making himself sound like just as much of a prick with this soundbite.",-1

As a result you have a lot of top ex pro's who are terrible pundits and a lot of mediocre ex pro's who are good at punditry.

\[edit\]: add to it Sneijder being player with most assists in UCL (his goal contribution was higher than Messi with 3g+6a vs 8+0\] and ex equo scored most goals in WC.



Messi scored 20 goals more... having as teammates pretty much core of Spanish NT. Heck, 2nd and 3rd place in Ballon d'Or voting? Literally his teammates. Without them? In WC 2010 he scored 0 goals and got 1 assist in team that scored 10 goals.",1
