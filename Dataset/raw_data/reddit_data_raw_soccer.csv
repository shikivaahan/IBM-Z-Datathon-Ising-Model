Burnsy825,WorldNewsMods,"Trump suggests Zelenskyy is to blame for the Russia-Ukraine war - Politico

>Donald Trump blamed Russia’s war on Ukraine on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy — an escalation of a pattern of sympathetic rhetoric toward the war’s aggressor, Russian President Vladimir Putin.

>“He should never have let that war start. The war’s a loser,” Trump said, referring to Zelenskyy, on a podcast with conservative commentator Patrick Bet-David published Thursday. The former president added that President Joe Biden had “instigated that war,” which he has repeatedly maintained “would never have happened” if he had been president.

>Trump has demonstrated an increasingly friendly relationship with Putin over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. During his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris last month, he maintained that the war must end — but twice did not directly answer if he thought Ukraine should win.

>And in a book released on Monday, journalist Bob Woodward reported that Trump had called Putin as many as seven times since leaving office and sent him Covid-19 tests for his private use while he was still president. Trump has not confirmed or denied the report.

Israel can move its citizens back north. Lebanon can move its citizens back south. And the Lebanese Army takes control.

hauntedSquirrel99,MothraEpoch,"It's easier to defend when you know what's coming.

Think of it like this, if I said I was going to hit you in the head, you'd know you'd need to focus on threats to your head.  
If I said I was going to hit you somewhere, then you'd have to watch out for threats to your entire body.

Similar principle. By knowing if it's ground launched missiles, aircraft carried missiles, stealth or non-stealth, etc.  
Those are factors that complicate a defense. If you can cut some of them out you have an easier time knowing what to look for.

But the really big thing is that it's more evidence that Washington is leaking, and leaking a lot at that. This type of highly classified documents are the kind of shit that no one should see other than some historian digging through declassified files in 80 years time.

If this shit is leaking, everything is leaking (and leaks were already a problem). Which is a problem for Israel specifically this time, but also any and all US allies (like Ukraine, Japan, Korea, all of NATO, etc). Because it means anything that's told to them is no longer secure.

The norwegians should be asking themselves how much of the Russian border intel they should be sharing.  
The finns the same.  
Ukraine are surely thinking ""how much of our operational plans can the Americans be trusted with?"", because if they're thinking of opening a front or moving a brigade to reinforce somewhere, can the Americans be trusted with it or will that end up in Moscow?

And that's just for the allies.  
It's also a US concern. Where are their resources, how much of anything do they really have, where are the weak points.  
Well the US know.  
Maybe Iran knows too, maybe China knows, maybe Russia knows.

They're part of intel programs all around the world, are all those intelligence agencies thinking ""hey, maybe we shouldn't be sharing resources here?"" Which weakens everyone's ability to gather information.

Military movements are quite telling because most operations will be practiced.

So the Israeli airforce for example has been running very specific drills that simulate what they're trying to do.

For a different example, operation neptune spear (killing of bin laden) included redirecting a specific navy seal squadron that was being shifted back from deployment (so as to not attract attention), they did 2 practice runs in the US in a replica compound then when they were secretly moved to Afghanistan they did drills on a full scale replica there for a week and a half.

If bin laden had known about that he could have moved, he could have reinforced, put up weapons capable of shooting down helicopters, etc.

I'm talking like this issue needs to be taken seriously.

A consistent issue with Reddit for the past 2 years is underestimating our enemies while they sit comfortably and crack dumbass jokes or posting copium.

When the Ukraine conflict began, people were making stupid jokes about Russian incompetence. And yet 2 years later, not only are Ukrainians fighting tooth and nail to defend their land against a savage enemy, but the conflict is now escalating with NK involvement.

Israel lets its guard down for one second and the consequences of that were devastating.

Sundrawn,Eheh00999,"האביב הערבי היה די טוב לישראל, לא מבין מה התלונות בנושא.
מה הקשר של האחים המוסלמים? 
איך את מצפה שתהיה לו שליטה על גוף קיצוני במדינה ערבית בדיוק?

אם את מתכוונת להעלות נושא בבקשה תוודאי שהוא רלוונטי.

אני לא חושב שאת מטומטמת, אני פשוט מבין שאת מונעת על ידי פחד ואי וודאות, כמו הרוב שתומך בטראמפ ובשטויות שלו.

So I decided to abstain. But people like you make me think about actually voting for Trump. 

Because you’re incapable of even having a discussion. Which scares me more than Trump.

Look if you want to vote Trump at least be strong in your convictions and stop looking for mean words the lunatic lefties said to try justify it to yourself.

>Because you’re incapable of even having a discussion. Which scares me more than Trump.

Yeah another absolutely top tier conclusion you've made here, be scared of the non-American who made a throwaway comment on reddit instead of the potential of the man who tried to overthrow your democratically voted election just 4 short years ago becoming president again.

המצב מפחיד ולפעמים זה מרגיש כאילו אין דרך החוצה.

עם זאת, אנחנו לא יכולים פשוט לזרוק את האמונה בפח ולתמוך באנשים שלא אכפת להם מהגיון וצדק.

אנחנו רוצים להיפרד מביבי ולהתחיל לבנות ממשלה הגיונית?
צעד ענק לכיוון הזה זה להוריד לו את התחושה שהוא יכול לעשות את כל מה שעולה לראשו.

נכון שקאמאלה לא תומכת בנו בצורה שהיינו רוצים אבל היא באמת חושבת לטווח הרחוק, וזאת תכונה נדירה בפוליטיקאי היון ואם זה לא קורה פה אז שלפחות זה יהיה אצל בני הברית שלנו.",2024-10-19 21:01:19
